AMR resistant in microbiome in vegetarian vs omnivores diet
This repository hosts the documentation and analytical code for the project *Analyzing Resistance in Microbiomes from Different Diets*. Our research focuses on the antimicrobial resistance profiles within the microbiomes of individuals adhering to vegetarian versus omnivore diets.

## Project Overview

In collaboration with experts from NIST and Georgetown University, this project aims to understand how diet influences microbial composition in the gut and its subsequent impact on the development of antimicrobial resistance.

### Key Questions Addressed:
- Which organisms harbor AMR genes in each diet?
- What is the composition of AMR marker-containing microbiomes for each diet?
- What classes of AMR are prevalent?
- Are there diet-specific AMR-positive species?
- What common organisms have AMR genes across both diets?

## Repository Structure
- final_presentation.Rmd: R Markdown document containing the complete analysis.
- scripts/: R scripts for data processing and analysis.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- Required R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, knitr, tidyr, plotly, pals

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse", "knitr", "tidyr", "plotly", "pals"))


## Running the Analysis
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the final_presentation.Rmd file in RStudio.
3. Click "Knit" to generate the HTML document, which will execute all R code chunks and compile the analysis results.

## Visualizations
Included in this repository are several critical visualizations:

- *AMR Gene Distribution Across Diets*: Displays the count and types of AMR genes found in each diet.
- *Diet Comparison*: Compares the microbial composition and AMR profiles between diets.
